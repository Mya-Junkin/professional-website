                    Hi, Iâ€™m Mya! I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have a strong passion for full-stack 
                    and mobile app development. Throughout my academic career, I have gained hands-on experience in various programming languages 
                    and have a knack for problem-solving.
                    <br /><br />
                    When I'm not coding, I love traveling to new places and learning new languages. I'm currently learning Spanish and have a 
                    keen interest in Hispanic culture. 
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition to my love for traveling and learning languages, I also have a creative side. I enjoy creating digital art, 
                    experimenting with different techniques, and expressing myself through different mediums.
                    <br /><br />
                    With my technical expertise and creative pursuits, I'm a well-rounded individual ready to take on new challenges and 
                    opportunities in the tech industry.
